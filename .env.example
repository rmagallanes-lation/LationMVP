# ===== LOCAL DEVELOPMENT =====
# Frontend should use this URL to reach the backend API (used by Vite)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Backend: URL for n8n webhook. If n8n is running on the same Docker host, use host.docker.internal inside containers:
N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=http://localhost:5678

# Frontend origin allowed by backend CORS
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

# ===== PRODUCTION (lation.com.mx) =====
# For production, use these values after deployment:
# VITE_API_URL=https://api.lation.com.mx (or your backend domain)
# N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=https://n8n.lation.com.mx/webhook/contact (or your n8n tunnel domain + webhook path)
# FRONTEND_URL=https://lation.com.mx (for backend CORS)

# Note: If using Cloudflare Tunnel for n8n, the URL is exposed via cloudflared tunnel route dns
